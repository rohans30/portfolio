			<h3>Dodgeball</h3>
			<h4>CSE: Scratch Project</h4>
			<p>The objective of this project was to make a game using scratch. My partner and I decided to make a sidescrolling dodgeball arcade game. 
			The controls use the arrow keys, and the spacebar to shoot. The bosses get harder and stronger every level so there's a sense of progression 
			as well. This project was a way to further our understanding about code and understand how the basic underlying functions work. My specific 
			role in the project was to work on documentation, but I ended up doing the majority of the coding as well. From this project, I learned how 
			basic code functions worked and saw how to put them all together to create an end product that functions and can be enjoyed. Some challenges 
			that we had to overcome were the difficulties of trying to work with two people who had their own opinions and agreeing one idea to use as the 
			end product. All in all, it was a great learning experience, and I learned a lot about coding and cooperating with others as well.</p>

			<h3>Trivia:Guess the Brand</h3>
			<p>The objective of this project was to make a game using App Inventor. My partner and I chose to make a trivia app where you need to guess
			the brand by looking at the logo. There's about 7 questions and we included different companies from apple and amazon, to pepsi and nestle.
			The project was a fun way to learn about how App Inventor and how it works, but also a great introduction to coding using blocks as well. It
			teaches us more about variable roles and functions as well sa they were pretty important in this project. In this project, I did most of the
			documentation for our notebook, but did a significiant amount of coding as well. This project taught me a lot about how many different outputs
			one specific function can have. There's a lot that can happen, and I learned that bug testing is pretty difficult if code isn't organized very
			well. Some challenges that we had to overcome was as I said earlier, organization of our code in order to find where the bugs were that were
			ruining our code. Overall however, it was a fun project and I actually learned quite a lot from the experience of coding it. It was also a fun
			game to play in itself!</p>

			<h3>Hangman in Python</h3>
			<p>The objective of this project was to make a game of Hangman in python. My partner and I chose to make a game with a space theme where you need to guess
			the word from a list of words related to space. There's about 17 words in total. The project was a fun way to learn about Python and how it works, but also a great introduction to coding using lists and dictionaries as well. It
			teaches us more about variable roles and functions as well, as they were pretty important in this project. In this project, I did most of the
			documentation for our notebook, but did a significiant amount of coding as well. This project taught me a lot about how difficult it is to iterate through lists and dictionaries using mulitple functions.
			There's a lot that can happen, and I learned that bug testing is pretty difficult if code isn't organized very well. Some challenges that we had to overcome was as I said earlier, organization of our code in order to find where the bugs were that were
			ruining our code. Overall however, it was a fun project and I actually learned quite a lot from the experience of coding it. It was also a fun
